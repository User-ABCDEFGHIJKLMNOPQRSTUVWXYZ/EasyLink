## 🧠 Power Search Tips

Use operators to improve search results:

- `"exact phrase"` – search exact words  
- `site:github.com actions` – search only GitHub  
- `filetype:pdf documentation` – find PDF docs  
- `intitle:api reference` – search titles only  

Works across most engines.

## 🚀 Why This Exists

GitHub Markdown does **not allow embedded search engines or scripts**.  
This page provides a **mini search experience** using public search URLs:

- Lightweight ✅  
- Fast ✅  
- Works on any GitHub Markdown page ✅  
- Easy to expand ✅  

Perfect for research, coding, and quick lookups.
