## 🧠 Who We Are

EasyLink is a small but growing project built by people who got tired of saying:

> “I KNOW there’s a good website for this… I just can’t find it.”

We are not a big corporation, not an algorithm, and definitely not a search engine trying to sell ads. EasyLink is a **curation-first project** focused on collecting genuinely useful, fun, and high-quality links from across the internet.

Think of us as internet organizers with too many bookmarks and a strong opinion about good websites.

## 🚀 Why EasyLink Was Started

The internet is huge, loud, and messy.

Great music sites, fun games, and useful tools are often buried under:
- Ads
- Clickbait
- Fake “top 10” lists
- Endless scrolling

EasyLink was created to fix that problem by building **one simple place** where people can quickly find links that are actually worth clicking.

No fluff. No spam. Just good links.

## 🛠 What We Do (And What We Don’t)

### What we do:
- Curate links for music, games, tools, and more  
- Keep everything organized and easy to browse  
- Update the collection regularly as new sites appear  
- Listen to community suggestions  

### What we don’t do:
- Track users  
- Sell ads  
- Promote low-quality or sketchy sites  

If a link is here, it earned its spot.

## 🌱 Where We’re Going

EasyLink is actively growing. New categories, better organization, and more curated content are added over time. The long-term goal is to make EasyLink a **go-to hub for discovering the good side of the internet**, without the usual noise.
